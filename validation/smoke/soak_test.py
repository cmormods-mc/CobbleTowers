"""A first real soak reading: many allocate/release cycles in a row, watching for anything that does
not come back down.

Every other live test in this suite runs one or two runs total. None of them repeats the cycle enough
times to notice a leak that only shows up on the hundredth allocation, not the first -- and TDS
section 11's own tracked counts (active runs, tower chunks, tower entities) are exactly what a leak
would move. This test's only job is repetition: create a run, walk it to ALLOCATING_INSTANCE for real,
then abandon it (the fastest path to a terminal state from anywhere, releasing its cell), over and
over, reading `/cobbletowers diagnostics` between cycles.

No real battle is fought. Real opponent spawn-and-cleanup is already proven by
`floor_encounter_test.py` and `participant_test.py`; what neither of them ever does is repeat the cycle
enough times for an accumulation to become visible, and that repetition is the whole reason this script
exists.

This is a SHORT soak (a few minutes by default) for a first real number, not the multi-hour or
overnight run TDS's own "long-running-server soak tests" phrase implies -- `--minutes` is there so a
future session can point this at hours unattended.
