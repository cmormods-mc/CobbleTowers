"""Proves what a lost Trick or Treat mimic costs, on a real server (the rest of the vault is walk_tower_test.py's).

Starts runs with fresh bots until floor 1's route offers a Trick or Treat stop and the vault rolls a trick. Then the mimic is lost on purpose (operator
command runs losemimic) and the team cashes out, so the run's loot is banked and the cut can be read from the log:

    the price is taken first (a ledger mark: "loot cut now 5%"), the loss gives nothing back ("beat the mimic" never appears),
    and the banked payout is cut ("payout is cut 5% by lost mimic(s)").

Needs the Halloween tower open (-Dcobbletowers.ignoreWindows=true), RCON on 25575, mineflayer and vec3 on NODE_PATH.
