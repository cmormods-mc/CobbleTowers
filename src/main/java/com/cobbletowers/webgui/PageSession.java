/**
 * What the server knows about one player's WebGUI pages, and the rules for what to do with a screen payload meanwhile.
 *
 * <p>WebGUI tells the server nothing when a player closes a page (Esc), so "is a page open" is a heartbeat: the page pings
 * every second or two and is considered open while the last ping is recent. A page that was just opened is "loading" until its
 * first {@code hello}; payloads that arrive meanwhile are kept and replayed at the hello rather than sent into a page that
 * is not there yet or used to open it a second time.
 *
 * <p>Plain Java with the clock passed in, so the timeline is unit-testable. Server thread only.
