 * @param entry where the party arrives
 * @param presentation where the opposing Cobblemon is shown
 * @param spectator where a knocked-out player watches from (TDS #25)
 * @param exit the way to the next floor
 * @param gateA the blocks that keep the party out of the intermission room until the floor is won (a walkable tower), if any
 * @param gateB the blocks that keep the party off the stair until everyone is ready, if any; a floor that has one is left on foot
 * @param doors the doors behind the pedestals, left to right: lane {@code i} of the route is door {@code i}; none on a floor with no doors
